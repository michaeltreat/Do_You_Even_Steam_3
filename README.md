# Do_You_Even_Steam_3

This is a remake of another SPA that I built that utilizes the Steam API. 

The app uses jQuery and PageJS for the front end and Express, Node, and PostgreSQL for the back end.

It also uses OAuth!

**NOTE :** The back-end is deployed on Heroku, but it falls asleep when not used after a certin amount of time. That means your first request may take a bit longer, as the server needs to wake up first. I'll add a loading image to fix this in the future.

You can sign into Steam with your account through OAuth.

OR

If you don't have an account, don't want to log in, or want to check out other user's stats you can just type a name into the form and it will show you the stats for that user as long as they exist and their profile is set to public!

Have fun!
